### What I learned

during this challange I learned about CSS custom properties. Declaring a custom property is done using a custom property name that begins with a double hyphen (--), and a property value that can be any valid CSS value. Like any other property, this is written inside a ruleset, like so:

```css
:root{
--White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--Pale-blue: hsl(221, 100%, 96%);
--Light-lavender: hsl(241, 100%, 89%);
--Dark-gray-blue: hsl(224, 30%, 27%);
}
```
Note that the selector given to the ruleset defines the scope that the custom property can be used in. A common best practice is to define custom properties on the :root pseudo-class, so that it can be applied globally across your HTML documen
